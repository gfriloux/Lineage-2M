| You don't need to have much HP to farm your mobs, as you will depend on HP Potions (so, how much HP you loose per mob).  
This means you will prefer to kill FAST (this is even more true once you get `Sonic Rage`).
| You will want high damage boost from your skills, and a good MP regen to use them more often.
| This leads to the following build:

.. list-table:: Stats priority

  * - STR
    - | Melee Damage.
      | Melee Accuracy.
      | Melee Critical Hit.
      | Weapon Defense.
  * - WIS
    - | Max MP
      | MP Recovery (Tick)
      | Skill Resistance
      | Skill Damage Boost
      | Heal Boost
  * - CON
    - | Max HP
      | HP Recovery (Tick)
      | Defense
      | Weight Limit
  * - AGI
    - | Attack Speed
      | Accuracy
      | Melee Evasion
      | Ranged Evasion
      | Magic Evasion

| You need high accuracy, or you won't touch anyone.
| You also need to survive (HP matters most).

      | Melee Critical Hit.
